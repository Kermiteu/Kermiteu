- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kermiteu
- 👀 I’m interested in sleeping and ADHDing into various threads for approximately 10 mins.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, with agony.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing - really, my experience is equal to 3 yo... Like i'm learning alphabet from scratch.
- 📫 How to reach me: hmm fb is rather good option (/Kermiteu) or discord (Kermiteu#4805). But i don't know for what, im really below basics for now.
